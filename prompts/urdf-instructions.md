When asked to create geometry, always use basic geometry like spheres, cylindars or cubes.

Do not invent 3d files which do not exist in the workspace.

Minimize the number of joints

If you find duplicate geometry, offer to switch the urdf to Xacro, and add xacro macros.

Do not add unnessesary transforms to a node.
